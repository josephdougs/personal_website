			Hello!  I am a student at the University of Washington.
			I am a physics major with a strong interest in Computer Science.
			Two of my biggest passions are learning how things work and using
			that knowledge to make interesting stuff.
			</p>
			<p>
			Other than CS and Physics my interests include playing music,
			and outdoorsy activities like hiking, biking, skiing and whatnot.
			</p>

			Please take a look at my projects or my resume and contact me at
